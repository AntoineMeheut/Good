UniqueWordList
--------------
 Extract from a file in RTF format a list of all the words in the file 
 without repetition.
 
 The purpose of this program is to offer good programming practices in 
 Python, when you want to build a program that can go to a computer 
 production target.
 
 The object of this program is to read a text and extract the list of 
 words without repetition. The functional interest is thus voluntarily 
 limited, to allow a developer who wishes to take note of some good 
 programming practices, to study them and to draw inspiration from them,
 without being too disturbed by the understanding of what the main 
 program and its modules does.

 This project was structured with Cookiecutter_ to have a good example 
 of a project in Python. You will find examples: tests components,
 modules structuring, documentation in the project components to 
 then create the documentation with Sphinx and a mechanism for 
 log management to the console and log files. Finally, this project 
 can be packaged with Setuptools.
